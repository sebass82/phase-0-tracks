# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control? Is keeping multiple versions of computer files organized
  Why is it useful?  Useful when multiple people are working on the same project and have different tasks that later need to be merged
* What is a branch and why would you use one? A branch is creating a copy of your work to work on.  This is useful if you are working on different aspects of the same prroject but want to keep the main branch untouched so that you can revert back to it if needed. 
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message? A commit is once you have finished with your changes and want to finalize them.  A good commit message is a message that lets anyone who hasn't seen your code know exactly what has been done.
* What is a merge conflict?  A merge conflict is when you cannot merge work from one branch back to a master branch
